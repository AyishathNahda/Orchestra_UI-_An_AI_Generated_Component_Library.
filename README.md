🚀 Velocity UI (UIVault)
Velocity UI is a high-fidelity component gallery built to demonstrate the power of "Generative UI" workflows. This project showcases how modern AI tools like v0 and Cursor can be orchestrated to build production-ready React interfaces at the speed of thought.

🛠 The Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js 15 (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animations: Framer Motion

UI Components: Shadcn/UI & Radix UI

Icons: Lucide React

Deployment: Vercel

✨ Key Features
Real-time Filtering: Interactive category filtering (Layout, Forms, Data) powered by React useState.

Bento-Grid Architecture: A responsive, modern grid layout designed for high-density information display.

Micro-Interactions: Hover states, smooth entrance animations, and glassmorphic effects using Framer Motion.

Orchestrated Workflow: Developed by converting AI-generated UI primitives into a cohesive, logically connected application.

🤖 The AI Workflow (GenAI Focus)
This project was built using a Human-in-the-loop AI workflow, which is a core focus of my approach to modern engineering:

Wireframing (v0): Used Vercel's v0 to prompt and iterate on complex UI primitives like the Bento Grid and Glassmorphic cards.

Orchestration (Cursor): Integrated independent components into a centralized Next.js application.

Refinement (Human Logic): Manually debugged hydration errors, optimized file structures (consolidating src/app), and implemented the filtering logic that AI tools often struggle to connect across multiple components.
